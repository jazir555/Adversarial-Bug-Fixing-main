Generates and refines code using multiple LLMs through adversarial testing.

== Description ==

The Adversarial Code Generator plugin enables WordPress users to generate high-quality code using multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) through an adversarial testing process. This ensures the generated code is robust, secure, and bug-free by leveraging the strengths of different AI models.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/adversarial-code-generator` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Configure your LLM API keys and settings through the plugin's settings page in the WordPress admin.

== Usage ==

1. Use the shortcode [adversarial_code_generator] in any post or page to display the code generation form to users.
2. Use the shortcode [adversarial_code_executor] to display the code execution form.
3. Use the shortcode [adversarial_git_clone] to display the Git repository cloning form.
4. Use the shortcode [adversarial_code_template template_id="your-template-id"] to display a code template.
5. Use the shortcode [adversarial_template_library] to display the template library.
6. Use the shortcode [adversarial_collaboration] to start a collaborative coding session.
7. Use the shortcode [adversarial_code_history] to display code generation history.
8. Use the shortcode [adversarial_security_scan] to perform a security scan on code.
9. Use the shortcode [adversarial_code_format] to format code according to language standards.
10. Use the shortcode [adversarial_code_translate] to translate code between programming languages.
11. Use the shortcode [adversarial_code_diff] to compare code versions.
12. Use the shortcode [adversarial_code_comments] to add comments to code.
13. Use the shortcode [adversarial_code_snippets] to access the code snippets library.
14. Use the shortcode [adversarial_code_sharing] to share code with others.
15. Use the shortcode [adversarial_code_environment] to create and manage code environments.
16. Use the shortcode [adversarial_ci_pipeline] to manage CI/CD pipelines.
17. Use the shortcode [adversarial_code_analysis] to analyze code quality.
18. Access the admin interface under "Adversarial Code Generator" in the WordPress admin menu to manage requests and configure settings.
